            <strong>Pychology</strong><br>
            Everyone knows someone who can walk into a room full of
people and, within minutes, give an accurate description about
the relationships between those people and what they are
feeling. The ability to read a person's attitudes and thoughts
by their behaviour was the original communication system
used by humans before spoken language evolved.
Before radio was invented, most communication was done
in writing through books, letters and newspapers, which
meant that ugly politicians and poor speakers, such as
Abraham Lincoln, could be successful if they persisted long
enough and wrote good print copy. The radio era gave openings
to people who had a good command of the spoken word,
like Winston Churchill, who spoke wonderfully but may have
struggled to achieve as much in today's more visual era.
Today's politicians understand that politics is about image
and appearance and most high-profile politicians now have
personal body language consultants to help them come across
as being sincere, caring and honest, especially when they're
not.
It seems almost incredible that, over the thousands of years
of our evolution, body language has been actively studied on
any scale only since the 1960s and that most of the public has
become aware of its existence only since our book Body Language
was published in 1978. Yet most people believe that
speech is still our main form of communication. Speech has
been part of our communication repertoire only in recent
times in evolutionary terms, and is mainly used to convey facts
and data. Speech probably first developed between 2 million
and 500,000 years ago, during which time our brain tripled its
size. Before then, body language and sounds made in the
throat were the main forms of conveying emotions and feelings,
and that is still the case today. But because we focus on
the words people speak, most of us are largely uninformed
about body language, let alone its importance in our lives.
